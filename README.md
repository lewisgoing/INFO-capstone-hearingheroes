# INFO Capstone Hearing Heroes

## Overview

Our project aims to enhance the emotional connection to music for adults with hearing impairments. By leveraging haptic feedback technology, we provide an alternative way to experience music beyond auditory mediums. The headband translates musical elements into vibrations, allowing users to perceive rhythm, bass, melody, and other sound patterns.
